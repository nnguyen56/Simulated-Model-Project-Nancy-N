This is a public repository that displays my R script on the Survival Analysis Model.

I wanted to predict how the severity of trauma can impact the time to a mental health event and determine the likelihood of survival. The input is the severity of the trauma. The x-axis is the time of a significant mental health event (i.e. a diagnosis of a mental disorder). The y-axis is the probability of survival.
